# Hexagon Grid

A basic algorithm

## Features
These are some features 

- [Project](https://github.com/Troy2000/Hexagon)

## Software Analysis 
I chose unity for this project because, I'm more experienced in it and the Hexagon grid assignment seemed like quite a difficult
process to make, therefore I chose to do this in C# and Unity. During this process I got the chance to learn somewhat more about
Math functions and basic algorithms to create certain formula.s

## Learning Goals 
What i wanted to learn in this project
- Math formulas
- Grids

## Planning 
This is my planning

| | maandag | dinsdag | woensdag | donderdag | vrijdag |

|week 1 |Choose an engine|Start doing research|Math formulas|start making one hexagon|
|week 2 |make multiple hexagons|Assign the hexagons to each other|finish the project|
